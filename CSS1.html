		<h1>What is Cyber Security?</h1>

		<p>
			Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, 
			networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic 
			information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be
 			divided into a few common categories.
		</p>

		<h1> The scale of the cyber threat </h1>

		<p>
			The global cyber threat continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with a rising number of data breaches each year. 
			A report by RiskBased Security revealed that a shocking 7.9 billion records have been exposed by data breaches 
			in the first nine months of 2019 alone. This figure is more than double (112%) the number of records exposed 
			in the same period in 2018.

		<p>
			Medical services, retailers and public entities experienced the most breaches, with malicious criminals responsible
		      for most incidents. Some of these sectors are more appealing to cybercriminals because they collect financial and medical data,
			but all businesses that use networks can be targeted for customer data, corporate espionage, or customer attacks.
